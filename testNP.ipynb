First, we explicitly acknowledge a potential endogeneity in the relationship between a country‚Äôs economic performance (measured by labour productivity) and FDI by estimating a system of simultaneous equations. Second, we consider direct and additional indirect effects, which can be tracked through the system of equations when deriving our conclusions. Third, we base our estimations on a sample including OECD as well as selected non-OECD countries for seven manufacturing industries over the period 1981‚Äì2000. The results suggest a positive relationship between FDI and output as well as productivity and export growth, whereas there is also evidence for a downward pressure on wage growth as a result FDI. However, the magnitude of effects is surprisingly small.\"\"\"\n",

To explore the effects of the pretreatment on the yield and composition of the produced syngases, both untreated and IL-pretreated HMCB were exposed to pyrolysis and gasification processes to highest temperatures of 700 and 900 °C with heating rates of 30 and 5 °C/min without and with zeolite, tincal, and potassium carbonate catalysts, respectively. Pyrolysis results show the negative effects of IL-based pretreatment of HMCB on syngas yield and its composition. In absolute terms, tincal and zeolite play positive roles in enhancing the syngas yield and H2 concentration obtained from catalytic pyrolysis of the IL-pretreated HMCB, but not in comparison with the pyrolysis of the raw biomass. On the contrary, the results demonstrate the synergetic effects of IL-based pretreatment of HMCB and its catalytic gasification toward higher syngas yield and H2/CO ratio with 32 and 153 respectively, compared to noncatalytic gasification of the raw HMCB. The catalytic gasification of the IL-pretreated HMCB revealed five times higher syngas yield (an H2-enriched syngas with lower CO2 content), compared to catalytic pyrolysis using tincal.',\n",

       "  'clean_text': 'The potential of Donnan dialysis to remove the bromide ions and associated ions (nitrates and bicarbonates) from a model solution was examined, using three anion-exchange membranes (AMEs) differing in their ion-exchange capacity and water content: Selemion AMV, Neosepta AFN and Neosepta ACS. Selemion AMV provided the most advantageous exchange of bromide ions for chloride ions and effectively limited co-ion transport, thus contributing to the lowest salt leakage into the feed observed in this study. The efficiency of bromide exchange ranged from 70 to 78 (for 500 μg Br−/L) at a salt concentration in the receiver of 100 and 300 mM NaCl, respectively. Anion exchange with Neosepta AFN (characterized by a loose structure) proceeded at a faster rate and provided a slightly lower efficiency of bromide removal (68–70 major advantage that Neosepta AFN offered was the short duration of the process (the time required for achieving minimal bromide concentration in the feed). Nonetheless, the loose membrane structure was responsible for the relatively high salt leakage into the feeding solution. The use of the monoanion-selective membrane Neosepta ACS brought about a concomitant decrease in the rate of anion removal, which extended the time required for obtaining a similar extent of bromide exchange (70–77 in the initial concentration of bromides in the feed (from 200 to 1000 μg/L) enhanced the efficiency of their exchange for chloride ions.',\n",
